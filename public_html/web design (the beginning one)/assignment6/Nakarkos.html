<h2>
Physiology
</h2>
<p>Nakarkos are massive cephalopod-like monsters. They have glowing yellow eyes, and massive, sharp beaks. They have blue skin with spots of turquoise bioluminescence. The most unique feature of an Nakarkos's body is its self-made covering of bones which it uses to protect and camouflage itself. Under normal circumstances, an Nakarkos's face cannot be seen. Its two primary tentacles are covered in vertebrae and tipped with skulls, creating the appearance of a two-headed skeletal dragon.

<h2>
Abilities
</h2>
<p>Nakarkos are capable of coating enemies in a sticky mucus which makes it easier for victims to become covered in the bones that litter the monster's lair. It can also shoot this mucus of the tips of its twin primary tentacles, and can burrow through the earth to surprise attackers from below. Being cephalopodic in nature, Nakarkos are adept swimmers and are very much at home in an aquatic environment. Nakarkos have also been observed replacing the skulls of its tentacles with body parts from other monsters, giving it a wider range of elements it can use. Nakarkos can concentrate the Dragon energy in their bodies to fire beams of this element from their tentacles or a much wider, deadly blast from their mouths

<h2>
Behavior
</h2>
<p>
Nakarkos are voracious predators and are unchallenged in their natural habitats. They capture and devour all manner of other monsters, including powerful flying and brute wyverns, and adorn themselves in the bones of their victims to protect their soft bodies. Nakarkos are very solitary creatures and live alone for much of their lives.

<h2>Habitat</h2>
<p>Nakarkos are adapted to inhabit underwater environments but are capable of living on land as well. They are known to make their lairs in subterranean caves which are connected to the ocean or other large bodies of water. On at least one occasion, Nakarkos have been sighted at the Wyvern's End.
