<h2>
Physiology
</h2>
<p>Glavenus is a large Brute Wyvern with dark red scales covering its body. Two rows of blue, bony plates run along its back, going from the eyes to the tail. Its underside is more of a cream color. The main feature of Glavenus's physiology is its huge, sword-like tail. The tail has originally the same color as its back plates, although it will turn a rusty color or a fiery red during the battle. Its hind legs are powerful and muscular, while its front legs are much smaller and mostly useless. The face and mandibles are covered in sturdy plating, particularly resembling a Carnotaurus ' head.
