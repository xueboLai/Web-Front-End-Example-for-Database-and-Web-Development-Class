	<p>
	Summary of the aticle and Response:
	<br>
	<br>
	As big data software develops in rapid speed, the big data market has to face a great issue: the problem of security. 
	<br>
	<br>
	For those big data open-source software, the longer it exists, the more vulnerable they would become. This is because, people can look and dig into its source code and find breaches of them. Once a big enough breach has been found, hackers’ attack might bring down the software immediately, which might cause a massive private data leak. Despite of the existing potential danger, major big data software companies still want to keep their eyes closed. As demonstrated by the article, Hadoop, one of the biggest big data infrastructure, though facing huge potential problem of security, is still reluctant to devote more time to protect data. As pointed out by an analyst in Gartner, “Less than 5 percent of Hadoop inquiries covered by the Info Mgmt team in 2014 discussed security.” Even though most of data software companies still don’t take security problem seriously, some new software companies, derived from Hadoop and Hortonworks, fortunately, begin to emphasize security and devote more time to deal with security problems.
	<br>
	<br>
	Actually, up to now, a lot of private critical information leaking from database has already been reported several times for different industries. Every time, they caused great harm to society and make people feel less safe. I think if the situation advances as the article predicts, we would soon encounter a major data leak. After this crisis, the software of big data might be shuffled and the market would start to realize the value of security and those data software emphasizing security feature will in a big rise.

	<h3 class = "maintext">Article2: How to answer the top three objections to a data lake           by John L. Myers</h3>
	<h3 class = "maintext"><a style = "text-align:center;" href = "http://www.infoworld.com/article/3095232/big-data/how-to-answer-the-top-three-objections-to-a-data-lake.html">URL of the article</a></h3>
	<p>
	Summary of the aticle and Response:
	<br>
	<br>
	The article states that Data Architecture is just like a pristine and clear lake, which can be used and drunk by everyone. It takes in all the questions and supply answers. However, for those who are not familiar with the knowledge of data lake and don’t want a change brought by data, they picture data as a dark swamp that is suspicious, inaccurate and misleading. Generally, those skeptical people usually raise these objections:
	<br>
	<br>
	1, messy data is in the way of development: 
With today’s integration management and processing technology, the sorted data can actually be utilized to find the connection between objects. This connection might then be used to develop new business model. The article uses Uber as an example. Uber alters the way of transportation, by the discovery of connection between people’s mobile phone and map through big data.
	<br>
	<br>
	2, Data might be wrong, the maturity and quality of the data can’t be assured:
“A data lake’s data quality practices are less about the syntactic quality of the data and more about the semantic quality of the data.”, as argued by author. This is to say, although there do exist problems of data lake such as data’s precision and quality, data still offers us potential discovery and use for business model. Those potential discovery and usages can have really important influence when it comes to future development of society. 

	<br>
	<br>
	Therefore, even though there might be some minor problem of data lake, it can still bring positive influence to us because of the possibility it offers. If we use data lake properly, the advancement of our world, the way different fields connected and industry’s architecture might be all changed greatly and positively.

	<h3 class = "maintext"><a style = "text-align:center;" href = "http://www.liquidweb.com/blog/index.php/ten-ways-databases-run-your-life/">URL of the article</a></h3>

	Summary of the aticle and Response:
	<br>
	<br>
	For governments, they can use database to track everyone’s tax and credits information. And government can make huge decision, based upon the public records in database such as medication data, financial data, and bank operating data. 
	<br>
	<br>
	In financial area, the database is used to record hundreds and thousands of stocks’ information including their historical prices and how the specific industry is performing. From those data, we will be able to forecast the future trend of stocks.
	<br>
	<br>
	<br>
	According to this article, the use of database has saturated to all fields of our life no matter we notice or not. The article lists some most common examples how database is influencing our real life. 
	<br>
	<br>
	The online video stream uses database to keep track of a person’s interest. Based on people’s interest, the database system will create recommendation to other shows for people. This technology can only be realized by using database management technology.
	<br>
	<br>
	The online gaming and social media’s gaming generate really massive data. Gathering user’s information, scores of the game and sharing games information back to users can only be processed and stored by database related technology. 
	<br>
	<br>
	Personal storage. The personal cloud technology allows you to store your files and information in “cloud” database so that you won’t lose data even your computer is broken. Also, the cloud allows you to syncing and share information across multiple platforms and device. 
	<br>
	<br>
	Personally, I believe that as our society becomes more and more sophisticated, people will be more rely on database than ever. And the database will make our life much easier and more efficient especially when we need to store data, use social media, make decision, find out certain connection between different fields, etc.  However, I do concern about the safety of database when it comes to some private data including credit cards information, housing records and personal credit records since there are already many cases about data leaking and personal data corrupted by hackers. In future, security problem would be a main hindrance of the database’s advancement.
