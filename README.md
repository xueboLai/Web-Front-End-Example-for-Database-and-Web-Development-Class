# personal_website
This is my personal website built from scratch. The website was mainly created when I was taking the Web developing class and database class. This website serves as a good example of what I am capable of doing in javascript, html, Bootstrap, php, mysql, etc.
For the stablility of the website, I did not enable most of the code in database design class.
